# PDF Utilities
A set of examples and utilities using the gofpdf package. Each folder contains its own README showing usage.

These are also the subject of a blog series [here](http://www.mandolyte.info/).

The examples contained are:
- write a PDF using a text file or Stdin
- create a numbered list with nice indentation
- convert a CSV file to PDF. This example shows a fitting method where the font size is adjusted to make the table fit without any folding of text in the cells. It returns an error if it can't fit using the minimum font size.
