# Heading One
This is a paragraph with some *emphasized text* - OK?

NOTE: for testing be sure to avoid CRLF formatted text. May need to develop a workaround for some issues with including CR characters.

## Heading Two
This is a paragraph with some **emphasized text** - OK?

### Heading Three
This is a paragraph with some ___emphasized text___ - OK?

#### Heading Four
*A wee bit of text*

#### Heading Five
Just some normal text... nothing fancy

###### Heading Six
This is really deeply nested.

Here is some code:
```
10 REM Old huh?
20 REM Yup, way old!
```
The file name is `oldcode.bas`.

These three lines should
only be one paragaph, but with BF retaining 
the newlines, the newlines must be replaced with spaces.

The below is a blockquote with inner codeblocks.

> Example:
> 
>     sub status {
>         print "working";
>     }
> 
> Or:
> 
>     sub status {
>         return "working";
>     }

This is the last line of the document.
